"""Write a class named Employee that holds the following data about an employee in attributes:
Name
ID Number
Department
Job title

Once you have written the class, write a program that creates three Employee objects to hold the following data:
Name: Susan Meyers
ID Number: 47899
Department: Accounting
Job Title: Vice President

Name: Mark Jones
ID Number: 39119
Department: IT
Job Title: Programmer

Name: Joy Rogers
ID NUmber: 81774
Department: Manufacturing
Job Title: Engineer

The program should store this data in three Employee objects and then print the data for each employee as shown exactly in the following sample run.
Note: Pay close attention to the placement of spaces, colons and blank lines in the sample run. Your output must match this.
